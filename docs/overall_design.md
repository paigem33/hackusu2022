Have a hand of dominos from the start.
Double twelve set.
Initial start for double twelve:
 * 2-4: 15 dominoes
 * 5-6: 12 dominoes
 * 7-8: 10 dominoes
A game round is where you comeplete one game using a starting double piece. The first double is the double twelve.
A train can be public or private. A private train mean only the owner can place dominoes on the train. If the train is public, any player can place a domino on the train.
One round in the game consists of a player placing a domino on either thier train or another player's train who's is public. If they place a domino on someone else's train, they have to make their own train public. They also have to go public if they cannot play.

A player is also able to draw one domino on their turn if they are unable to play the previous rules still apply.

If a double is played, then the player must also try to complete that double. If the player is unable to complete the double, then they must draw and try to play that one. If they are still unable to play, they must make their train public and the next player has to try to comeplete the double. This continues until someone is able to comeplete the double. The player that comepletes the double does not have to make their train public for playing on another's train.

When one player runs out of dominoes in their deck, the next players can do one more turn. After that turn, everyone counts their dominoes and that is their score. That score is then added to the total score for each player. If you end with the double zeros in your hand, you have to double your score.

The boneyard is a collection of dominoes that are extra from the initial sorting stage. When a person draws a domino because they couldn't play, it comes from the boneyard. If the boneyard is empty when they try to draw, the next rule applies.

If the boneyard runs out of dominoes before the game is over, the end of the tracks will be put in the hub and the rest of the pieces sorted back into the boneyard.

If your last domino is a double, then the game isn't over until the double is comepleted. This follows the previous double rules.
