For the main game view, have a hub with the main domino in the center with train "tracks" coming from the hub spots. Each player will have their own slot in the hub that is their "track". Each turn, a player will place a domino from their deck onto their train or another players train. (See rules for details).

For a public train, a locamotive will be rendered on the second to last number on the end of the track. There will also be a green dot on the hub to show it's public. If it's private, there will be a red dot. On the player's turn, the hub will also show their own line with green showing that they can play on their own.

At the top of the play display area, there will be the player's names, with how many dominoes they have in their deck, and the train color.

The player's deck will be displayed at the bottom of the play area within a box, showing the dominoes that are in the player's deck.
